SUMMARY:Rust\, WebAssembly\, and the future of Serverless by Steve Klabnik
DESCRIPTION:A lot of things have been said about WebAssembly inside of the
  browser\; after all\, that's why it was originally created. But a new cas
 e is emerging as well\, and that's WebAssembly on the server. More specifi
 cally\, we're seeing a rise of support for WebAssembly in serverless appli
 cation platforms\, combining two brand-new technologies together. We're al
 so seeing a lot of growth of the Rust programming language\, and its close
  alignment with WebAssembly. In this talk\, Steve will talk about Rust\, W
 ebAssembly\, serverless technologies\, and how it all fits together.
